We train the women to tackle her social challenges boldly, come forward and be a part of the new era of women empowerment and nation building. It acts as the womb for the social, cultural, economical and intellectual empowerment of women. <b>SHAKTHI</b> is based on Indian culture and upholds the sanctity of Indian woman hood. As such helping women to achieve economic independence by enabling them to have independent employment and income has been accorded the highest priority Promotion of Women’s Self-Help Groups (WSHGs) has therefore been adopted as a key strategy for achieving women’s empowerment and this applicable only through <b>SHAKTHI</b></p> 
<p>Our core focus in <b>VLCT & RC</b> is to provide skill building and skill up-gradation training who are associated with us and thereby substantially increase their income.

The main objectives of such exposure visits are: to enable the unskilled persons to take a first-hand look at how skilled women work; to facilitate interactions between the potential skill development trainees and the previously trained women; and to acquaint the unskilled persons with the different steps involved. This enables the people who are interested in enrolling for skill development training to take informed and well thought decision and start considering <b>SHAKTHI</b> as a sustainable source of livelihood. Women bear almost all responsibility for meeting basic needs of the family, yet are systematically denied the resources, information and freedom of action they need to fulfill this responsibility.
